# Tech Specs

UPDATE: I am trying out a new prototype for a LED Guitar instead of the mask. Lets see if yall can make some cool animations I can use for my set tomorrow!

1) Download or clone this repo which has LED animation studio
2) Create a 30 (height) x 22 (lenght) grid
3) Have fun making some cool animations!

I am still working on putting all the LEDs on, but here is a picture of the layout (keep in mind not all pixels in the grid will be visible)
